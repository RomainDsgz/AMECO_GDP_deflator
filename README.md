# AMECO_GDP_deflator

This script originally comes from @guillemvidal and has been adapted for my Master Thesis on the Swiss debt brake. Note that the period studied ranges from 1995 to 2023. This timeframe has been chosen for two reasons: most of the data in my thesis starts in 1995, and secondly because there are missing data for the composition of inflation before 1992. 

I thank the author for this useful script.
